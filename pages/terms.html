        policy that also includes all published policies and procedures. It
        holds inividual students and groups of students responsible for the

        authorities/officials that the Student is in breach of the Terms<br/>
        of this Code of Conduct shall be final and binding on the Student.<br/>
        <h3>5.</h3> At FWSA, we value an educational environment that respects
        the values of individual students and their personal and professional<br/>
        development. We strive to create and maintain an environment in which

        <br/>
        <h3> The following criteria will be used to determine if an incident

        <h3>6.</h3> If someone brings concerning behaviour to our attention,
        FWSA will work to determine if there is an actual or alleged violation,

        additional information (such as past behavioural history), and the
        context we may have.<br/>
        <h3> a) </h3> Actions taken to prevent future occurance may be
        educational in nature (such as a success plan) or may include actions
        including but not limited<br/>
        to suspending a Student or terminating the engagement of the Student
        with FWSA.<br/>
        <h3> b) Important note: </h3> we encourage critical thought, discourse,
        and feedback from our students, and none of the above is to discourage<BR/>
        criticism of FWSA itself, policies, or anything else. We value your
        feedback and welcome it anytime via feedback@fwsa.freshworks.com<br/>
        <h3> c) </h3> We hold our student community to high standards and expect
        staff, instructors, and students to engage with each other in a
        professional manner.<br/>

        <h3>7.</h3> All students are expected to know and abide by the Code of
        Conduct and all published policies and procedured. In addition, we may
        from time to time publish <br/>
        announcements to students for them to abiide by - for example in the
        #announcemnts channel in Slack about topics related to the Code of
        Conduct.<br/>
        <h3>8.Attendance, PUnctuality & Leave of Absence:</h3> FWSA expects each
        Student to actively participate in their course by attending all
        lectures, lab hours,<br/>
        having an online presence during course hours, engaging with thier
        instructor and collabrating with other Students. <br/>
        <h3> a) </h3> Students must follow a five-day working shedule from
        Monday to Friday. Classes are sheduled from 9.00 am to 7.00 pm (Mon-Fri)
        and must make<br/>
        themselves available on a need basis on Saturdays for any special
        classes or mentor hours when requested.<br/>
        <h3> b) </h3> Students must have a minimum attendance of 90% during the
        course duration (every month) in order to be eligible to sit for demo

        prior permissio of the FWSA by addressing & getting confirmation<br/>
        via email to discipline@fwsa.freshworks.com<br/>

        <h3> f) </h3> The Student agrees that such admission for the next batch
        shall be at the ole discretion of FWSA.<br/>
        <h3>9.Completion of Assignmnets, projects and coursework: </h3> FWSA
        expects students to complete each and every assignment given as part of
        the course<br/>
        within the due date specified because. the concepts learned in one
        assignment are a building <br/>
        block needed for future assignments. Even if a student knows a concept,
        repetation solidifies <br/>
        the foundation of their knowledge. We encourage Students to reach for
        stretch goals and practice <br/>
        on their own. Students must have at least90% assignment submission rates
        (within due dates), <br/>
        if the completion rates are below 90% disciplinary action will be taken
        i.e., granting of warning <br/>
        to the Student, suspension of the stipend to Student, the expulsion of
        the Student from the program<br/>
        as mentioned in FWSA T&C clause-4.<br/>
        <h3>10.Integrity:</h3> FWSA expects students to maintain high standards
        of academic integrity. Breaches of academic integrity include, but are
        not limited to<br/>
        inappropriate colloboration, cheating, sharing solution code,
        plagiriasm, copyright infringement, and inaccurate citation. Asking for
        help <br/>
        and researching online is a key part of learning; however, Students
        cannot use the code that has been wrtten by someone else.<br/>
        <h3>11.Inappropriate Collabrotion-</h3> Collaboration on assignmnets is
        prohibited unless explicity permitted by your instructor. The goal of
        FWSA and your experience<br/>
        here is to learn the material to master. While we welcome both
        self-reliance and peer engagement, if a Student is caught<br/>
        inappropriately collaborating, a member of the Curriculum team/
        Operation team will evaluate the situation. Based on findings,<br/>
        the Student may face disciplinary action, up to being suspended or
        rusticated from FWSA.<br/>
        <h3>12.Cheating-</h3> Cheating can be a tricky subject in the world of
        collaboration and open source. For our purposes, we define cheating as:<br/>
        <h3> a) </h3> Using somenone else's code and passing it off as your own
        (even if you understand it);<br/>
        <h3> b) </h3> Giving your solution code to a classmate to copy from;<br/>
        <h3> c) </h3> Copying from classmates, instructors' solution code,
        unless otherwise advised. Although you can google, read articles<br/>
        and documentation, and review code snippets and examples for help, you
        should be able to put all these assistance<br/>
        tools aside and write code from scratch - if you cannot do this, you do
        not understand the concept and you need to spend more time on it.<br/>
        <h3> d) </h3> If a student is caught cheating, a member of the
        curriculum team/ Student Operation team will evaluate the situation.
        Based on findings, <br/>
        the Student may face disciplinary action, up to being suspended or
        rusticated from FWSA. Determination by the instructors or through<br/>
        online protoring that the STudent has cheated will be binding on the
        Student.<br/>

        <h3>13.Sharing Code Solutions:</h3> FWSA projects and curriculum are the
        property of FWSA, any unauthorized sharing of project solution code
        within or outside<br/>
        of the FWSA community may result in dismissal from the program. FWSA
        owns all code for FWSA assigned projects,<br/>
        including any code written by a Student for projects outside of the core
        FWSA curriculum until the completion <br/>
        of the two-year program but published after the completion of the
        Program.<br/>

        <h3>14.Plagiarism:</h3> Plagiarism is a form of academic dishonestly
        that includes the wrongful appropriation of another's work, thoughts,
        ideas, or expression.<br/>
        If a student is caught plagiarizing, which can include copying code from
        instructors, other Students, outside sources, or generally<br/>
        submitting work that is not their own, a member of FWSA will evaluate
        the situation. Based on findings, the Student may face<br/>
        disciplinary action, up to being withdrawn from FWSA.<br/>
        <h3> a) </h3> Both the code receiver (copier) and code giver (enabler)
        will be subjected to a code of conduct under unfair means, cheating,
        forgery, impersonation.<br/>
        <h3> b) </h3> Upon expulsion, we may update the GitHub, against your
        profile the student was aked to leave in lieu of the Code of Conduct.<br/>
        <h3>15.Respect and Professionalism - </h3> FWSA is fortunate to have
        Students, instructors, and staff from extremely diverse backgrounds.<br/>
        Contribute to creating a positive experience for everyone by bein
        respectful in communication (sarcasm translates <br/>
        poorly via text and online chat). Students are expected to do their part
        to make FWSA a welcoming place to learn<br/>
        by encouraging their fellow students, offering support, and listening to
        others. FWSA does not tolerate discriminatory,<br/>
        harassing, or insulting remarks to other students, instructors, staff,
        or anyone else, online in-person; please see the<br/>
        Non-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment policy below.<br/>
        <h3> a) </h3> FWSA is a professional environment. It is expected that
        Students act accordingly. Punctuality, timelines, accountability,<br/>
        and open communication are crucial not only for a Student's success at
        FWSA but also in their careers afterwards.<br/>
        The professional expectations FWSA requiress of its Students are the
        same a Student's future employers will expect of them.<br/>
        Professionalism should be a theme that runs through a Student's work and
        interactions at FWSA. This includes<br/>
        communication via slack, Zoom, the content of a Student's work, and
        naming conventions. A good rule<br/>
        of thumb is: if a Student wouldn't do or say it in frnt of an employer
        or colleagues at thier job,<br/>
        they shouldn't do it here at FWSA. Additionally, professionalism
        includes protecting the intellectual <br/>
        property of FWSA or the company. That means Students respect copyright
        and ownership of other's materials <br/>
        and those of FWSA itself.<br/>
        <h3> b) </h3> Violations of the Code of Conduct may result in a warning,
        suspension or withdrawal from the program (whole or <br/>
        part thereof). If a student is suspended or rusticated from the program
        (whole or part of thereof) for Code of Conduct<br/>
        related violations, applicable provisions of the FWSA T&C will be
        enforceable. If a student thinks there <br/>
        is something that is preventing them from being successful, they should
        communicate with their instructor<br/>
        or IA's, or reach out directly to feedback@fwsa.freshworks.com.<br/>
        <h3>16.</h3> Ask for help If a student feels lost or is stuck on an
        assignment, it's their responsibility to reach out to their instructor
        for help.<br/>
        Others can only provide support if Students let them know. Students may
        not always be given the answer, but they will be provided with the<br/>
        tools to come up with the answer on their own. Students should use the
        following order in asking for help on technical problems/challenges<br/>
        and coursework:<br/>
        <h3> a) </h3> First attempt to solve the problem. Do not ask for
        immediate help, this will hamper your problem-solving ability.<br/>
        <h3> b) </h3> Reach out using the program's Slack help channel.<br/>
        <h3> c) </h3> Reach out to the instructor for help if still not
        resolved.<br/>

        <h3> 17.Disciplinary Measures that may be imposed under the Code include
            but are not limited to: </h3>
        <h3> a) </h3> Written/Email/Slack warning, reprimand, suspension, during
        which the Student shall be required to fulfill certain conditions &
        demonstrate<br/>
        good behaviour.<br/>
        <h3> b) </h3> Students may be required to issue an apology letter.<br/>
        <h3> c) </h3> A student may lose certain privileges including but not
        limited to removal from Slack or other such tools/not being allowed to
        sit for demo day and placement services.<br/>
        <h3> d) </h3> Depending on the severity of the breach, the Student may
        be expelled from the course and the applicable provisions of the FWSA
        T&C will be enforceable.<br/>
        <h3> e) </h3> Violation pursuant to the Sexual Harassment of Women at
        Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 will be
        applicable to and binding on the Student.<br/>

        <p> All powers relating to discipline and disciplinary action in
            relation to the students of FWSA shall vest with the Head of the
            FWSA Program. <br/>
            <h3> The Head of the FWSA Program </h3> may delegate all or any of
            his powers as he/she deems fit, to such other officers as he/she may
            nominate on that behalf.<br/>
